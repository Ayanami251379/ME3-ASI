ME3 ClientMessage Exposer

This plugin uses a console window in order to show string parameters of the ClientMessage function used by ME3's PCC scripts.

Originally from Unreal Engine 3, the ClientMessage function is supposed to show a temporary message on the screen, and also log it on the console. ME3 devs kept the function, but removed its code, so nothing is shown at all in the final game.
