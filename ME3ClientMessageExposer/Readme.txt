ME3 ClientMessage Exposer

This plugin allows the viewing of content passed as string parameter to the ClientMessage function used by ME3's PCC scripts. It now uses its own window (old version used a console window).

Originally from Unreal Engine 3, the ClientMessage function is supposed to temporarily show a message on the screen while logging it on the console. ME3 devs retained the function but removed its code, so nothing is displayed at all in the retail game.
