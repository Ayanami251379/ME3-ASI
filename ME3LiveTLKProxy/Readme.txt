ME3 Live TLK Proxy

This plugin will replace the Live TLK (server-side talk table downloaded by the game from the EA servers) with any user-made, valid TLK file you want.

The replacement TLK must be named ServerTLK.tlk, and put in "Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32" or "Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32\ASI" (the latter path will be ignored if the file is already found in the former).

Note that, unlike the Live Coalesced, ME3 requests talk tables according to the game's current language setting. Your ServerTLK.tlk will override EA server's even if it's from a different language.
