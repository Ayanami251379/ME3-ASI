ME3 Master Plugin

This plugin works like the good old binkw32.dll:
- bypasses the DLC verification (you may use any official, modded or user-created DLC's);
- enables the command console (Unreal Engine 3 feature - TAB: single line, Tilde: full console);
- bypasses the certificate check for SSL connections (this is intended for making the game to connect to ME3 Private Server Emulator, though it won't affect connection with official EA servers in any way).

THIS PLUGIN IS *NOT* SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH ME3 AUTOPATCHER (BINKW32.DLL + BINKW23.DLL), BECAUSE AUTOPATCHER ITSELF ALREADY DOES WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES.
