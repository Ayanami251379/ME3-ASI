ME3 Balance Changes Replacer

This plugin will replace the server-side Coalesced (balance changes for MP) with any custom Coalesced you want, as long as your file is named ServerCoalesced.bin, and put in "Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32" or "Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32\ASI" (the latter path will be ignored if the file is already found in the former).

This plugin SHOULD NOT require zlib1.dll.

Do I have to write here that you shouldn't use this plugin along with Balance Changes Disabler?
