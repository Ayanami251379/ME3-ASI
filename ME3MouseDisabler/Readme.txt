ME3 Mouse Disabler

This plugin effectively hides the mouse pointer while the game is running by replacing a function pointer to GetCursorPos from User32.dll with a pointer to a "fake" function where mouse position is never set or returned.

This plugin is supposed to be used with SP and MP Native Controller Support mods available at me3tweaks.com.
