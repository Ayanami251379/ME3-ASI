# ASI Plugins for Mass Effect 3

This is a collection of various plugins (DLL files renamed to *.asi) which provide new features and functionalities to the game. The biggest advantage of ASI plugins is that it's easy for users to choose which features they want, and enable/disable them at any time. Anyone can make and distribute their own plugin.

**An ASI Plugin requires the use of a separate ASI Loader in order to be used / Intended for use with ME3 Autopatcher available at https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32**

**How to use a plugin:** simply drop ME3xxx.asi in 'Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32', or 'Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32\ASI'. You're not limited in how many plugins you can use at a time.

**Disabling a plugin:** delete the respective .asi file. Alternatively, you can instead move it to another folder, or rename it so it doesn't end with ".asi" (or, if you're using 'ASI' folder, rename it to disable all plugins).

All plugins available here:
- are intended for use with Mass Effect 3 1.5 only.
- were made under Visual Studio 2012 Update 4. They require the following VC++ runtimes: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679
