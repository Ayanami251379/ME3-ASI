ME3 Origin Unlinker

This plugin nullifies ME3's integration with the Origin client, so the game will act like it was cracked. The changes made by this plugin were tracked down from the RLD cracked EXE.

This plugin does not crack Mass Effect 3 (original EXE needs an Origin account with a valid license in order to be decrypted; plugins are always loaded after decryption).

This plugin has no effect on RLD crack (it has the link already broken by itself).

Last, but not least: this plugin allows the use of "offline" profiles from ME3 Private Server Emulator while playing with original EXE (that's what I actually meant when I said the game acts like it was cracked). Login as "OriginPlayer" (temp. guest profile) will no longer be possible then.
